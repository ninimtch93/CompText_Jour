Body


The Joint Economic Committee released the following testimony by Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street
Institute, from a hearing dated June 4, 2024, entitled "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
Growth and Improve Governance":

***

Chairman Heinrich, Vice Chairman Schweikert, and members of the Committee:

Thank you for the invitation to participate in this important hearing on "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to
Fuel Economic Growth and Improve Governance." My name is Adam Thierer, and I am a senior fellow at the R
Street Institute, where I focus on emerging technology issues. I also recently served as a commissioner on the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce's Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competitiveness, Inclusion, and Innovation.1

Today I will discuss three points relevant to this hearing:

1. First, AI and advanced computational technologies can help fuel broad-based economic growth and sectoral
productivity while also improving consumer health and welfare in important ways.

2. Second, to unlock these benefits, the United States needs to pursue a pro-innovation AI policy vision that can
also help bolster our global competitive advantage and geopolitical security.

3. Third, we can advance these goals through an AI Opportunity Agenda that includes a learning period moratorium
on burdensome new AI regulations.

I will address each point briefly, but I have included three appendices to my testimony offering more details.

AI Could Drive Economic Growth, Increase Sectoral Productivity, and Improve Human Well-Being

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 19
      Joint Economic Committee Issues Testimony From R Street Institute Senior Fellow Thierer (Part 1 of 2)

AI is set to become the "most important general-purpose technology of our era," and AI could revolutionize every
segment of the economy in some fashion.2 The potential exists for AI to drive explosive economic growth and
productivity enhancements.3 While predictions vary, analysts forecast that AI could deliver trillions in additional
global economic activity and significantly boost annual GDP growth.4

This would be over and above the $4 trillion of gross output that the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says the
U.S. digital economy already accounted for in 2022.5 [See Appendix I] But what really matters is what AI means for
every American personally. AI is poised to revolutionize health outcomes, in particular. AI is already helping with
early detection and treatment of cancers, strokes, heart disease, brain disease, sepsis, and other ailments. AI is
also helping address organ failure, paralysis, vision impairments, and much more. The age of personalized
medicine will be driven by AI advancement. [See Appendix 2] AI can help make government more efficient, too.6
Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted recently used an AI tool to help sift through the state's code of regulations and eliminate
2.2 million words' worth of unnecessary and outdated regulations.7 California Gov. Gavin Newsom just announced
an effort to use generative AI tools to improve public services and cut 8 percent from the state's government
operations budget.8 And regulators are using AI to facilitate compliance with existing policies, such as post-market
medical device surveillance.9 AI also holds the potential to achieve administrative savings for federal health
insurance programs or, better yet, reduce the number of people dependent on them by identifying and treating
ailments earlier.10

Computational Freedom Is Important for America's Geopolitical Competitiveness and Security

There is an important connection between AI and broader national objectives. A strong technology base is a key
source of strength and prosperity, so it is essential that we do not undermine innovation and investment as the next
great technological race gets underway with China and the rest of the world.11 Luckily, U.S. AI innovators are still
in the lead. Had a Chinese operator launched a major generative AI model first, it would have been a "Sputnik
moment" for America. Still, China has made its imperial ambitions clear with a goal to become the global leader in
advanced computation by 2030, and it has considerable talent, data, and resources to power those ambitions.12
Experts argue that "China's whole-of-society approach is challenging America's traditional advantages" in advanced
technology.13 We need a pro-innovation national AI policy that will not only strengthen our economy and provide
better products and jobs, but also bolster national security and allow our values of pluralism, personal liberty,
individual rights, and free speech to shape global information platforms and markets.14 If fear-based policies
impede America's AI development and diffusion, then China wins.15

Protect the Freedom to Innovate with an "AI Opportunity Agenda"

                                                                                                 Page 4 of 19
      Joint Economic Committee Issues Testimony From R Street Institute Senior Fellow Thierer (Part 1 of 2)

To achieve the benefits AI offers and meet the rising global competition, America needs an AI Opportunity Agenda.

An AI Opportunity Agenda begins by reiterating that the freedom to innovate is the cornerstone of American
technology policy and the key to unlocking the enormous potential of our nation's entrepreneurs and workers.16 As
part of this Agenda, Congress should craft a learning period moratorium on new proposals, such as new AI-specific
bureaucracies, licensing systems, or liability schemes, all of which would be counterproductive and undermine our
nation's computational capabilities. [See Enclosure I] In addition, this moratorium should preempt burdensome state
and local regulatory enactments that conflict with our national AI policy framework.17

Next, Congress should require our government's existing 439 federal departments to evaluate their current policies
toward AI systems with two purposes in mind. First, to ensure that they are not over-burdening algorithmic systems
with outdated policies, and second, to determine how existing rules and regulations are capable of addressing the
concerns that some have raised about AI. Taking inventory of existing rules and regulations can then allow
policymakers to identify any gaps that Congress ought to address using targeted remedies.

Finally, an AI Opportunity Agenda requires an openness to new talent and competition.18 With experts finding that
a "talent war is brewing between the US and China," and that China is moving ahead in some important ways, we
must take steps to attract and retain the world's best and brightest data scientists and computer engineers.19

Conclusion

In sum, America's AI policy should be rooted in patience and humility instead of a rush to over-regulate based on
hypotheticals and worst-case thinking.20 We are still very early in the AI lifecycle, and there is still no consensus on
how to define the term, let alone legislate beyond establishing definitions.21 To ensure America leads this next
great technological revolution, Congress must once again uphold the freedom to innovate and craft a flexible, risk-
based AI policy vision to ensure we can meet global competition, advance economic opportunity, and improve the
well-being of every citizen.

Appendix 1: How AI Could Drive Economic Growth and Sectoral Productivity

Over the past half century, there have been waves of both great excitement and disillusionment about the prospects
for AI advancement.22 AI historians often speak of the many AI "springs" and "winters"--what one might think of as
AI booms and busts--that have come and gone.23 It did not help that some of AI's early pioneers over-exuberantly
predicted that powerful "superintelligence" would be with us in short order. In the late 1960s, for example, noted AI
researchers confidentially predicted that "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man
can do," (Herbert A. Simon), and that "[i]n from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general
intelligence of an average human being" (Marvin Minsky).24 Such exuberance was replaced by pessimism in the
1970s, resulting in a "winter" period for AI research and investment.

Today, however, AI is generally thought to be in the midst of another spring as enthusiasm grows around specific
capabilities and applications. Economists predict that AI is set to become the "most important general-purpose
technology of our era."25 General-purpose technologies will become intertwined with almost every other economic
sector and used ubiquitously throughout society.26 These developments are coming about because we live in an
era of rapid-fire combinatorial innovation in which new technologies are building on top of one another in a
symbiotic fashion, further accelerating their development and sophistication.27 Improving Many Sectors, Including
Government

The power of algorithmic technologies is all around us in products and services such as speech and image
recognition tools on our smartphones and the recommender systems many media providers and other companies
use to tailor goods, services, and content to our interests. AI will be used by almost all organizations to help
improve analytics and marketing, enhance customer service, and boost sales or performance in various new ways.
And it will completely upend the way production and work is done in countless fields and professions.

AI and ML capabilities are operating behind the scenes to help with fraud and spam detection, computer virus
filtering, content management/moderation,28 mapping/navigation,29 travel planning,30 weather forecasting and
natural disaster prediction,31 warehouse automation/inventory management,32 supply chain management,33 and
various other logistics.34 For example, in 2021, McKinsey & Company estimated that "[s]uccessfully implementing
AI-enabled supply-chain management has enabled early adopters to improve logistics costs by 15 percent,
inventory levels by 35 percent, and service levels by 65 percent, compared with slower- moving competitors."35
These productivity enhancements will likely accelerate as algorithmic techniques are further refined.

AI and ML capabilities also power most of the devices that make up the so-called Internet of Things and various
connected "smart" devices, including many wearable technologies and other devices with embedded sensors.36
Another related term here is ambient computing37 or ubiquitous computing, which essentially means "using
computers without knowing that you are using one," or using smart systems without explicitly calling them
computers.38 These technologies have powerful health and medical applications, among other things.

Meanwhile, various AI-powered robotic technologies are already at work in many industrial sectors.39 AI, ML, and
advanced robotics technologies promise to revolutionize many fields including advertising and marketing,40
agriculture,41 archeology,42 auto safety,43 aviation,44 education,45 endangered species protection,46 energy and
climate solutions,47 entertainment,48 financial services,49 legal services,50 retail,51 transportation,52 and
others.53 Going forward, every segment of the economy will be touched by AI and robotics in some fashion;
therefore, it should be equally clear that public policy will be transformed in the process.

AI will affect government processes, too.54 In April 2024, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted used an AI tool to help sift
through the state's code of regulations and eliminate 2.2 million words' worth of unnecessary and outdated
regulations.55 In May 2024, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an effort to use generative AI tools to
improve public services and cut 8 percent from the state's government operations budget.56 AI is also being used
by regulators to facilitate compliance with existing policies. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has been using AI for post-market medical device surveillance.57

      Joint Economic Committee Issues Testimony From R Street Institute Senior Fellow Thierer (Part 1 of 2)

The potential exists for AI to drive explosive economic growth and productivity enhancements.58 While predictions
vary, most analysts believe that "AI will have a significant economic impact."59

* According to Grand View Research, a market research and consulting company based in India and the United
States, the global AI market was valued at $93.5 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual
growth rate of 38.1 percent from 2022 to 2030./60

* A 2018 McKinsey study estimated that "AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic activity of around
$13 trillion by 2030, or about 16 percent higher cumulative GDP compared with today. This amounts to 1.2 percent
additional GDP growth per year."61 In the summer of 2023, McKinsey released another study estimating that
generative AI alone could add up to $4.4 trillion of value to the global economy annually.62

* An earlier PwC report forecast a $15.7 trillion potential contribution to the global economy by 2030./63

* A 2023 Goldman Sachs report predicted AI could help boost U.S. labor productivity by 1.5 percentage points each
year, while Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates AI will add an additional 1.0 percentage points
to productivity growth over the 2025-2028 timeframe.64 Goldman also says generative AI could drive a 7 percent
(or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP over a 10-year period.65

* Another leading economist with a specialization in technology argues that AI will double productivity in the coming
decade.66

Even if AI's economic impact falls far short of those estimates, it would still generate enormous growth opportunities
across many segments of the economy. AI is also invigorating new types of tech competition, especially from open-
source players and platforms.67 It also promises to benefit small businesses by creating new products and jobs. A

U.S. Chamber of Commerce report finds that 87 percent of small businesses reported increased efficiency due to
new technology platforms and that one in four small businesses are already using AI.68 The Past Can Be Prologue

If this potential for explosive growth still sounds outlandish, consider that, in 1998, Nobel Prize-winning economist
Paul Krugman infamously predicted that the internet's impact on the global economy would be "no greater than the
fax machine's."69 President Bill Clinton thought differently, predicting that the internet's potential was "nothing short
of revolutionary" and that "[i]n just a few years, it will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and
services."70

Clinton's optimism was vindicated. Electronic commerce exploded, and digital innovation became the foundation of
significant economic growth, new jobs, and boundless speech opportunities. According to the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis, in 2022, the U.S. digital economy accounted for over $4 trillion of gross output, $2.6 trillion of
value added (translating to 10 percent of U.S. GDP), $1.3 trillion of compensation, and 8.9 million jobs.71 These
astonishing results came about thanks to wise bipartisan public policies formulated by the Clinton administration
and a Republican-led Congress.72 Freedom to innovate was America's policy default for digital services, and
burdensome state regulations (and even taxes) were preempted to a degree.73 Federal policymakers made a firm
break with the old regulatory models of the analog era, which had constrained competition. The results speak for
themselves. In addition to generating remarkable economic output and opportunity, this approach resulted in global

                                                                                                Page 11 of 19

dominance of digital technology markets. Today, 18 of the 25 largest digital companies in the world are U.S.-based,
and it is difficult to name any from Europe.74 In essence, as a recent Wall Street Journal headline observed, the
European Union now "regulates its way to last place" on digital technology.75

This should serve as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers. America got policy right for the internet, but the sort of
approach adopted for AI remains to be seen. If we want U.S. firms to once again lead the world--and help counter
China's looming influence on AI markets in particular--it is essential for policymakers to strike the right policy
balance once again.76

Appendix 2: AI's Potential for Improving Medicine and Health Outcomes

AI is already revolutionizing the field of healthcare and the practice of medicine.77 Increasingly powerful algorithmic
systems--often combined with new wearable technologies--are already helping many people better monitor their
health and fitness.78 Generative AI tools will also supplement remote medicine with virtual health care
assistants.79 More sophisticated AI tools are allowing doctors and scientists to create highly personalized care
options and develop new medical treatments tailored to the unique needs of each patient.80 As two medical experts
and authors of The Age of Scientific Wellness have noted, "those who fold these systems into their practices will be
doing their patients (and themselves) a great service" because "they are akin to having not one expert but
thousands upon thousands, all working together at top speed. Because AI is generally inexpensive to run once it
has been developed, the potential for optimizing care and making it radically cheaper is striking."81 AI and ML-
enabled technologies are already having a profound impact on public health. Machine learning refers to the
processes by which a computer can train and improve an algorithm or computer model without step-by-step human
involvement.82 In 2022, for example, an AI technology from Google DeepMind called AlphaFold was able to model
the structure of nearly all known proteins, representing "a significant advance in biology that will accelerate drug
discovery and help address problems such as sustainability and food insecurity."83 Researchers from the
Fundamental AI Research Team at Meta have a competing ML-created database of 617 million predicted protein
structures.84 These advances are leading to what some researchers call a "protein design revolution" driving "the
next quantum leap in the biotech industry," which could completely transform medicine.85 This competition
continues, as DeepMind announced the latest and more powerful iteration of AlphaFold in April 2024./86

A Broad Range of Health Benefits

AI, ML, and robotics are driving many other major medical advances today, becoming a crucial part of early
detection of various ailments and diseases.87 "Artificial-intelligence algorithms are processing vast troves of data
in electronic medical records, searching for patterns to predict future outcomes and recommend treatments," notes
a Wall Street Journal medical reporter.88 "They are creating early-warning systems to help hospital staff spot subtle
but serious changes in a patient's condition that aren't always visible or noticed in a busy unit, and predicting which
patients about to be discharged from the hospital are at highest risk of being readmitted."89 Here are some other
specific examples of how AI, ML, and robotics technologies are already advancing medical science and helping
improve health outcomes.

* Organ donation: In the field of organ donations, "[p]aired kidney donation is one of the great success stories of
artificial intelligence," helping doctors and patients by taking "an incredibly complex problem and solves it faster
and with fewer errors than humans can, and saving more lives as a result."90

* Heart attack detection and treatment: AI and ML tools are helping detect and treat heart disease and heart
attacks, a leading cause of death globally.91 Scientists at Cedars-Sinai developed an algorithmic tool in 2022 that
can quantify coronary plaque buildup in five to six seconds compared to at least 25 to 30 minutes before.92 This will
greatly improve the ability to predict who will have a heart attack. Other researchers have developed AI tools to help
improve personalized treatment for women who have had heart attacks.93 Women who suffer a heart attack have a
higher mortality rate than men, often because their symptoms are not properly understood or diagnosed.
Meanwhile, the British National Health Service recently started using a new AI tool that can detect heart disease in
just 20 seconds while patients are in an MRI scanner, compared with the 13 minutes or more it usually takes
doctors to analyze images manually after performing a scan.94

* Cancers: President Richard Nixon declared a national "war on cancer" over 50 years ago.95 More recently, the
Obama and Biden administrations pushed for a "cancer moonshot."96 Unfortunately, cancers remain the second
leading causes of death in the United States,97 claiming 602,350 lives in 2020 alone.98 AI and ML-enabled
technologies are poised to help reduce that staggering death toll. Mayo Clinic researchers have shown how ML
models can help diagnose and treat pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage.99 Pancreatic cancer is the third leading
cause of cancer deaths, claiming 46,774 lives in 2020./100 British scientists have recently reported on new AI
software that can spot signs of pre-cancer during endoscopies in 92 percent of patients, which could significantly
lower deaths from esophageal cancer.101 AI/ML techniques are also helping with early fast, accurate way of
diagnosing heart attack," detection and treatment of lung cancer,102 breast cancer,103 brain cancer,104 cervical
cancer,105 and many other types of cancer106 (including undiagnosable cancers107), aided by increasingly
personalized screening techniques.108 The FDA has started approving more AI-powered medical devices that can
help facilitate early detection of the most prevalent cancers.109 AI-enabled cancer detection tools can help alleviate
some of the workload that human radiologists and other cancer doctors face.110

* Sepsis and superbugs: Recent medical studies have also documented how AI-powered monitoring systems are
helping detect antibiotic-resistant "superbugs"111 and sepsis,112 saving thousands of lives each year as a result.
Roughly 1.7 million adults develop sepsis each year in the United States, and more than 250,000 of them die.113
Researchers find that the use of AI "dramatically cuts the time it takes to sort through thousands of promising
compounds" to fight drug-resistant pathogens.114

* Paralysis: The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation has estimated that nearly 1 in 50 people in the United
States are living with paralysis.115 The combination of AI and robotic technologies holds promise for helping
paralyzed individuals regain certain motor functions.116 In May 2023, a Dutch man paralyzed from the waist down
for more than a decade regained his ability to walk thanks to brain and spine implants and an AI-enabled thought
decoder that helped him translate electrical brain signals into muscle movement.117 He is now able to walk around
his own home and get in and out of a car on his own. A paralyzed American man regained his sense of touch and
mobility thanks to similar AI-enabled brain implants.118 AI and ML capabilities are powering other brain-machine
implants that are helping address disabilities in other ways, including regaining the ability to speak after a
stroke.119 And The New York Times recently documented how a woman who lost her arm in an accident is now
able to control her new prosthetic robotic arm thanks to advances in AI and sensors embedded in her body.120

* Mental health and drug addiction: AI can help identify and address mental health problems through textual
analysis, which can supplement human-based analysis at a time when there is a nationwide shortage of health care
workers in this area.121 AI tools are also being tapped to help find novel drugs that can help counter opioid
addiction, which has become a chronic problem in recent years.122 There are many other current or potential
health-related applications for algorithmic technologies, including abnormal chest X-ray detection,123 AI-powered
ultrasounds,124 new drug and vaccine discovery,125and detecting and addressing eye disease and blindness.126
In April 2024, the National Institutes of Health announced a new breakthrough in AI retinal imaging that produces
high-resolution images of cells in the eye 100 times faster and with a 3.5-fold improvement in image contrast.127 AI
and ML will power other advanced learning capabilities that will help doctors and scientific researchers access and
understand massive amounts of patient and health data and put it to even better use. These same capabilities will
help innovators create new personalized health monitoring and tracking systems for the public.128

AI Will Help Doctors, Nurses, and Scientists Advance Treatments

In 2022, I served as a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's "AI Commission on Competition, Inclusion, and
Innovation," a group formed to study AI governance. At a spring 2022 field hearing, our Commission heard remarks
from Cleveland Clinic CEO and President Tom Mihaljevic, MD and several of his colleagues.129 These doctors and
scientists highlighted how they were already using AI/ML to improve patient care and save lives. They noted how
teams of doctors and researchers are now able to share information from tissue samples with much larger teams of
medical experts, who can--with the help of algorithmic systems--work together at a distance to better understand
and use all the information at their fingertips. Additionally, along with other medical centers, the Clinic has
developed better AI-driven methods to detect irregular heartbeats and strokes and to diagnose degenerative brain
diseases like Alzheimer's, dementia, and Parkinson's.130 This only scratches the surface of what AI/ML will mean
for patient care.131 Dr. Mihaljevic noted that, when he started practicing medicine in the 1980s, the overall volume
of medical information doubled roughly every seven years; today, it doubles every 73 days.132 Meanwhile, 7,000
medical papers are published every day.133 A recent study in Science shows that, in the closely related field of
medical robotics, the number of scientific papers has grown exponentially from less than 10 published in 1990 to
more than 5,200 in 2020.134 These numbers align with broader trends in technical and scientific literature. "Since
the scientific literature doubles roughly every 12 years, this means that of all scientific work ever produced, half of it
has been produced in the last 12 years," note the authors of The Science of Science.135
