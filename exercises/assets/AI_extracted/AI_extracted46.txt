(TNSres) -- NetApp, a provider of software, systems and services to manage and store data, issued the following
news release:

NetApp(R) (NASDAQ: NTAP), the intelligent data infrastructure company, today announced cyber-resiliency
capabilities that will equip customers to better protect and recover their data in the face of ransomware threats.
NetApp is one of the first to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) directly into enterprise
primary storage to fight ransomware in real-time. The NetApp cyber-resiliency capabilities protect both primary and
secondary data for organizations whether it is stored on-premises or in the cloud.

Cybercriminals are increasingly aiming ransomware attacks at critical infrastructure and supply chains where
operational disruptions can cost millions of dollars, according to Forrester. As a result, 87 percent of C-suite and
board-level executives ranked ransomware as a high, or the top, priority for their organization, according to the
NetApp 2023 Data Complexity report. When cybercriminals breach perimeters, networks, and identities storage
becomes the last line of defense for organizations' most critical data. With the threat of ransomware looming,
organizations need solutions that not only protect their data but also quickly recover lost data and return to normal
operations. NetApp is updating its cyber-resiliency solutions and leveraging the power of AI to give customers
confidence that their data will be safe and accessible when they need it.

"NetApp is taking an aggressive and proactive approach to protecting our customers' data against cyber threats
using artificial intelligence. We are the first storage vendor to explicitly and financially guarantee our data storage
offerings against ransomware," said Mignona Cote, CSO at NetApp. "Today, we are furthering that leadership with
updates that make defending data comprehensive, continuous, and simple for our customers."

NetApp is focused on designing data storage and management systems that maximize data protection and security
while meeting data governance and compliance standards, with new updates that include:

* ONTAP Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) will spearhead the next
generation of real-time enterprise storage ransomware protection, giving increased accuracy and performance
required to detect and mitigate new, more sophisticated cyber threats. NetApp pioneered autonomous real-time

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 4

detection of ransomware directly in primary enterprise storage three years ago. Now, NetApp will be leading the
charge to use adaptive AI/ML models built directly into enterprise primary storage to look at file-level signals in real-
time to detect even the newest ransomware attacks with planned 99%+ precision and recall. NetApp will be offering
the first technology preview of ARP/AI within the next quarter.

* NetApp BlueXP Ransomware Protection, now in public preview, provides a single control plane to intelligently
coordinate and execute an end-to-end, workload-centric ransomware defense. Customers can now identify and
protect critical workload data with a single click, accurately and automatically detect and respond to a potential
attack, and recover workloads within minutes, safeguarding their valuable data and minimizing costly disruption.

* Application-Aware Ransomware Protection via NetApp SnapCenter 5.0 offers immutable ransomware protection
for applications. SnapCenter will now apply NetApp's leading ransomware protection technologies, previously used
with unstructured data, to application-consistent backup. SnapCenter 5.0 includes support for key ONTAP features
like tamperproof Snapshot copy locking, SnapLock protected volumes, and SnapMirror Business Continuity to
enable more robust data protection for applications and virtual machines. SnapCenter 5.0 supports protection of
applications on-premises with NetApp AFF, ASA, and FAS, as well as in the cloud.

* NetApp BlueXP Disaster Recovery, now generally available, offers seamless integration with VMware
infrastructure and provides storage options for both on-premises and major public cloud environments. This
comprehensive solution eliminates the need for separate standby disaster recovery (DR) infrastructure, reducing
costs. With NetApp BlueXP disaster recovery, failover and failback processes are simplified, allowing smooth
transitions from on-premises VMware infrastructure to the public cloud or to an on-premises data center.

* NetApp Keystone Ransomware Recovery Guarantee extends NetApp's current Ransomware Recovery
Guarantee to our leading storage-as-a-service offering, NetApp Keystone. With this guarantee, NetApp will warrant
snapshot data recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. If snapshot data copies can't be recovered through
NetApp, we will offer compensation*.

"Today's cybersecurity teams face the monumental task of protecting their companies' data from ever-evolving
threats, especially ransomware," said Archana Venkatraman, Research Director, Cloud Data Management, IDC.
"NetApp's approach of delivering a secure, unified storage infrastructure makes storage foundational for
ransomware protection and reduces the burden on cybersecurity teams. Companies looking to fortify their cyber
resiliency and shifting protection left will increasingly look to vendors that take a secure-by-design approach and
develop unified storage and data services."

"Using NetApp in our Advanced Technology Center, we significantly simplified our replication process for VMware
virtual machines and their underlying datastores to meet or exceed recovery benchmarks," said Derek Elbert,
Solutions Architect at WWT. "With NetApp's solutions, we successfully established the recovery policies for cloud
volumes workloads or virtual machines with no existing DR strategy, managing everything through NetApp BlueXP.
This transforms how we operate disaster recovery for VMware."

"To store sensitive genomics and health data, we have to use the right technology with layers of security built in,"
said Mark Cowley, Deputy Director at Children's Cancer Institute. "With NetApp, we can be very confident that we
are sharing the right data only to authorized researchers. The last line of defense is your weakest web-based
system, so we've implemented role-based access and added resilience to all of our tools."

The latest cyber resiliency updates from NetApp empower organizations to proactively address cybersecurity
threats in complex hybrid and multicloud environments, leveraging AI to identify threats and prevent disruptions to
their operations.
