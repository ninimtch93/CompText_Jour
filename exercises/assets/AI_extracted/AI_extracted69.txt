Today, leading AI meteorology company Atmo announced a multi-year commercial agreement with the Philippines'
Department of Science and Technology ( DOST ). In collaboration with DOST's Advanced Science and Technology
Institute (ASTI) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA),
Atmo will provide ultra-precise weather forecasting throughout the country. Using AI models specifically trained on
Philippines weather data to achieve significantly higher accuracy and detail, this landmark contract will deliver a
national-scale weather forecasting solution at a high, 2km resolution - up to 100x more detailed than standard
global forecasts.

The Philippines is highly vulnerable to extreme weather and climate change. The country faces up to 20 tropical
cyclones each year , impacting millions of Filipinos and causing widespread displacement and loss of life. In total,
the Philippines experiences more annual economic losses from weather events than any other country. Atmo's AI
forecasts will enable the Philippines to take proactive measures in mitigating these climate challenges, reducing
loss of life and infrastructure damage, while enhancing a wide range of industries, such as agriculture, aviation, and
renewable energy.

"This collaboration represents a clear example of how AI can revolutionize weather forecasting on a national scale,"
said Dr. Pierre Pinson, Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Forecasting. "By integrating AI-based models
with local meteorological data, the Atmo-Philippines partnership puts forward a new approach to meteorology for
countries that face unique and recurrent extreme weather conditions."

Atmo combines real-time data from large volumes of weather sensors, satellites, and radars with over 60 years of
historical data to create ultraprecise AI weather prediction models. These forecasts update every 15 minutes and
continuously self-correct using real weather measurements, improving over time. Its partnership with the Philippines

promises groundbreaking improvements in accuracy, detail, and computational efficiency, redefining the future of
weather forecasting for the nation.

"We're incredibly proud to partner with DOST to bring the Philippines a weather forecasting system that can help
safeguard lives, boost economic activity, and enhance disaster preparedness," said Alex Levy, CEO of Atmo.
"Using the power of AI-driven meteorology, the nation can make informed decisions to navigate the increasing
challenges posed by extreme weather with confidence and precision."

The implementation of this AI-powered weather forecasting model will begin immediately, with full operational
capability expected within the next year. Atmo's proven AI technology is also being used by the Pacific island nation
of Tuvalu , which faces immediate and existential threats from the climate crisis.
