Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, issued the following news release:

SBA has publicly touted its "artificial intelligence tools" yet continues to report that it has not used AI.

Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, is exposing Biden's Small
Business Administration (SBA) for pursuing costly Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology while many SBA offices
and programs lack even basic internet technology (IT) security, putting Americans' personal information at risk.

The SBA has mainly used its $22 million IT Working Capital Fund (IT WCF) to prioritize pet projects that support
questionable policy changes and AI, while the agency as a whole continues to fail federal IT standards and has
significant security risks in its systems. Additionally, the SBA has not complied with an executive order that directs
federal agencies to list where and how they use AI.

To get answers and accountability, Ernst is calling on SBA Administrator Guzman to provide a full accounting of
how SBA is making investments from their IT Working Capital Fund budget.

She wrote, "It is vital the SBA use its IT WCF for authorized purposes only and make appropriate investments to
modernize IT infrastructure throughout the agency. The SBA has not done so, reportedly spending significant funds
on IT projects within some divisions, such as the Office of Capital Access, even as other offices appear to lack the
capacity to perform basic IT functions, like importing data from Excel spreadsheets.

"Specifically, SBA was cited as having ineffective management when it came to risk, supply chain risk, IT
configurations, and identity and access policies. It also had ineffective data protection and privacy, security training
for personnel, information security continuous monitoring capabilities, and contingency planning.

"The SBA needs to do better, especially given the fact that thousands of Social Security Numbers were used to
commit fraud and identity theft in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster
Loan (COVID-19 EIDL) programs.

"Additionally, the SBA has not complied with Executive Order (EO) 13960, Promoting the Use of Trustworthy
Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government, which directs federal agencies to list where and how they use AI.

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 3
                  Ernst Exposes SBA's Lack of IT Security as the Agency Pursues AI Technology

The SBA has touted its 'artificial intelligence tools for fraud review on all loans in the 7(a) and 504 Loan
Programs,' 'sophisticated automated reviews,' 'advanced data analytics,' 'machine learning functionality,' and
'artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions.' The SBA also launched an updated Lender Match tool that
verifies borrowers and screens for fraud. In a recent interview, you stated that the SBA has embraced AI. Despite
this, the SBA has not been transparent and reports that it has not used AI."
