San Francisco, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., April 18, 2024 -- Pano AI
(Pano), the leader in artificial intelligence-driven wildfire detection, proudly announces its achievement of the
ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). This certification marks a
significant milestone in Pano AI's commitment to information security, privacy, and operational excellence in
supporting communities against the escalating threat of wildfires.

"Attaining this certification underscores our dedication to safeguarding the information assets of our customers and
our organization," stated Sonia Kastner, CEO of Pano. "This achievement is a testament to our team's hard work,
our technology's reliability, and our diligent approach to process, ensuring we are implementing the information
security protection necessary to serve sophisticated and stringent customer requirements.”

Pano’s mission is to harness the power of advanced artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technology to enhance
disaster response and management capabilities. Its technology provides governments, utilities, private landowners,
and fire agencies with advanced tools for early wildfire detection, verification, and communication. This approach
transforms how stakeholders respond to new ignitions and mitigate catastrophic wildfires, offering a robust solution
to enhance safety and reduce potential damages.

To achieve the certification, Pano engaged an independent, ANAB-accredited audit firm for a comprehensive
evaluation. The process reviewed Pano’s operational framework, including policies, procedures, and controls of
people, processes, and technology.

Benefits of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification include:
    •     Enhanced information security and management practices, providing stronger protection of information in
          all forms and reinforcing trust with partners, customers, regulatory bodies, and communities.
    •     A commitment to the continuous improvement of security measures and a systematic approach to
          identifying, managing, and mitigating information security risks.

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 2
