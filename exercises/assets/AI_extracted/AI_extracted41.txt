WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- The U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory issued the
following press release:

Just as fast as technology is changing, so is the threat landscape. More frequent and intense disasters put
pressures on emergency operations centers (EOCs) to rapidly share and analyze data that informs decision-
making. At the GovAI Summit 2023, a panel with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and
Technology (S&T) Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and other emergency management
practitioners discussed how science and technology-specifically artificial intelligence (AI)-can help.

"Technology is a changing opportunity space for emergency preparedness and response, and we see that more
than ever with the current emergence of AI. This panel was a great chance to focus on both the challenges and
opportunities AI presents for emergency managers and first responders who help keep us safe," said Ryan Eddy,
PNNL director of homeland security programs.

The panel, "The EOC of the Future: How AI Will Transform Emergency Ops," explored how AI can help emergency
management advance from data overload to prediction and adjustment.

"With today's tools, there is a lot of data that can inform decision-making, but emergency managers need to be able
to access it and use it-and fast. At PNNL, we are enabling secure, trustworthy, science-based AI and machine
learning programs to advance capabilities, particularly in image analysis and cyber defense," Eddy said.

Eddy's presentation, "Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology for Emergency Management," highlighted
PNNL AI tools and analysis capabilities, such as Rapid Analytics for Disaster Response, which combines image-
capturing technology, AI and cloud computing to assess damage and predict risks during extreme events, and
Sharkzor tool, which is an AI-driven, scalable web application that makes it possible to quickly characterize and sort
electron microscopy images used to analyze radioactive materials.
