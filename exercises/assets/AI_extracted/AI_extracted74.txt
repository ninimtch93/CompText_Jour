DISCount, created at UMass Amherst, derived from two very different needs: Counts of damaged buildings in crisis
zones and bird flock sizes

A team of computer scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst working on two different problemshow to
quickly detect damaged buildings in crisis zones and how to accurately estimate the size of bird flocksrecently
announced an AI framework that can do both. The framework, called DISCount, blends the speed and massive
data-crunching power of artificial intelligence with the reliability of human analysis to quickly deliver reliable
estimates that can quickly pinpoint and count specific features from very large collections of images. The research,
published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, has been recognized by that
association with an award for the best paper on AI for social impact.

"DISCount came together as two very different applications," says Subhransu Maji, associate professor of
information and computer sciences at UMass Amherst and one of the paper's authors. "Through UMass Amherst's
Center for Data Science, we have been working with the Red Cross for years in helping them to build a computer
vision tool that could accurately count buildings damaged during events like earthquakes or wars. At the same time,
we were helping ornithologists at Colorado State University and the University of Oklahoma interested in using
weather radar data to get accurate estimates of the size of bird flocks."

The Palu Tsunami, which struck Indonesia in 2018. The data consisted of 113 high-resolution satellite images.
Counts of the buildings and their damage levels were collected per tile using before- and after-disaster satellite
images. Colors indicate different levels of damage (red = destroyed), and DISCount gave an estimate of damaged
buildings per sub-region.

Maji and his co-authors, lead author Gustavo Perez, who completed this research as part of his doctoral training at
UMass Amherst, and Dan Sheldon, associate professor of information and computer sciences at UMass Amherst,
thought they could solve the damaged-buildings-and-bird-flock problems with computer vision, a type of AI that can
scan enormous archives of images in search of something particulara bird, a rubble pileand count it.

But the team was running into the same roadblocks on each project: "the standard computer visions models were
not accurate enough," says Perez. "We wanted to build automated tools that could be used by non-AI experts, but
which could provide a higher degree of reliability."

The answer, says Sheldon, was to fundamentally rethink the typical approaches to solving counting problems.

"Typically, you either have humans do time-intensive and accurate hand-counts of a very small data set, or you
have computer vision run less-accurate automated counts of enormous data sets," Sheldon says. "We thought: why
not do both?"

DISCount is a framework that can work with any already existing AI computer vision model. It works by using the AI
to analyze the very large data setssay, all the images taken of a particular region in a decadeto determine which
particular smaller set of data a human researcher should look at. This smaller set could, for example, be all the
images from a few critical days that the computer vision model has determined best show the extent of building
damage in that region. The human researcher could then hand-count the damaged buildings from the much smaller
set of images and the algorithm will use them to extrapolate the number of buildings affected across the entire
region. Finally, DISCount will estimate how accurate the human-derived estimate is.

"DISCount works significantly better than random sampling for the tasks we considered," says Perez. "And part of
the beauty of our framework is that it is compatible with any computer-vision model, which lets the researcher select
the best AI approach for their needs. Because it also gives a confidence interval, it gives researchers the ability to
make informed judgments about how good their estimates are."

"In retrospect, we had a relatively simple idea," says Sheldon. "But that small mental shiftthat we didn't have to
choose between human and artificial intelligence, has let us build a tool that is faster, more comprehensive, and
more reliable than either approach alone."
