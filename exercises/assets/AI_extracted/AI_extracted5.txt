PR NewswireThe pioneering organization was awarded a $500,000 grant from Open AI to explore how artificial
intelligence can increase its impactATLANTA, July 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --Operation HOPEhas become the first
financial literacy nonprofit organization to embed artificial intelligence into its model. Open AI awarded its first-
ever grant to a community-based organization with $500,000 to help build out Operation HOPE's financial coaching
and support services. The grant was announced in December 2023 during theHOPE Global Forums | Annual
Meeting in Atlanta. Operation HOPE CEO John Hope Bryant and Open AI CEO Sam Altman also announced the
formation of a first-of-its-kind AI Ethics Council, which held its inaugural meeting on June 28th.

 The pioneering organization was awarded a $500,000 grant to explore how artificial intelligence can increase its
impact.To date, Operation HOPE has deployed artificial intelligence to:Optimize coaching effectiveness and
improve Operation HOPE's client experiences.Apply machine learning to identify specific actions and activities
HOPE Financial Coaches can do to improve coach-client interactions.Upgrading the client management system to
formulate AI-driven pathways to guide them toward improved outcomes.The partnership evolved when Mr. Altman
and Mr. Bryant joined together for a listening tour at Clark Atlanta University in the spring of 2024. They determined
that they share concerns about bias and discrimination in AI, yet also believe that AI can overwhelmingly positively
impact lives and create new economic opportunities for people of color. By working with HBCUs and civil rights
leaders, who have a rich history as shapers and guardians of civil liberties—along with deep experience in
understanding and guiding ethical decision-making during historical-critical junctures— the AI Ethics Council is
designed to help ensure the inclusivity of marginalized populations and people of color during this economic
revolution.At the inaugural meeting, James Hairston, Open AI's Head of International Policy and Partnerships,
briefed members on the current state of AI, including its challenges and opportunities. Mr. Bryant shared that he will
be convening a meeting of tech leaders to advance issues important to the council, and announced the Council
website will go live July 1, 2024. "I see this website as our first stake in the ground. Its substance will grow, expand,
and deepen over time. Transparency will be a hallmark. I encourage all citizens, here and abroad, to get informed
and educated around what AI really is and isn't," said Mr. Bryant. "As a council, we aim to focus our attention on the
needle we can help move: expanding inclusive opportunity around our shared future, for everyone, as it relates to
AI."A full replay of the conversation between Mr. Bryant and Mr. Altman at the Hope Global Forums can be
