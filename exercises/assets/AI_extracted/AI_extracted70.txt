(Cihangir Mahallesi &#350;ehit Jandarma Komando Er Hakan Oner Sk. No:1Avc&#305;lar/Istanbul) Abstract: This
invention; It is about the artificial intelligence-based emergency detection and notification system, which was
developed in order to prevent many people from injury and loss of life by detecting disasters or accidents that may
occur in areas where crowded groups of people work, such as factories, mines, business centers and its feature is;
at least one electronic device (2) that makes the operating status of the control panel (1) visible, at least one of the
sensors (3) or combinations of sensors that measure the air gas level, oxygen quality, carbon dioxide amount,
carbon monoxide amount, humidity and temperature of the environment according to the objects in the
environment, artificial intelligence algorithm (5) installed on the processor in the computing or central command
system, using the information received with the infrastructure established by the IOT sensor module (4) at points
such as factories and buildings, it contains at least one stimulus (6) that notifies visually or visually that an accident
or disaster situation will occur as a result of the processing of the data coming from the said sensor (3) by the
artificial                intelligence              algorithm                (5).                 For                more
