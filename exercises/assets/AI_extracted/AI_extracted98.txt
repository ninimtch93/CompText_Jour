PR NewswirePITTSBURGH, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- StockSnips Inc., a leader in AI-powered investment
strategies, announces the launch of its first ETF, NEWZ, now trading on (NASDAQ).StockSnips AI-powered
Sentiment US All Cap ETF (NEWZ)represents a significant leap forward in the integration of artificial intelligence
and natural language processing within financial markets, offering investors a unique opportunity for long-term
capital appreciation. This advancement is underpinned by the firms' substantial investments in AI technology and
comprehensive validation of models, reflecting years of innovation and commitment to building AI that has the
advantage of recognizing patterns that are non-stationary, an issue with current traditional quantitative models.

 StockSnips stands apart from conventional ETF Managers, born from the vision of AI and Data Science specialists.
The founders bring over six decades of AI experience to the table, including entrepreneurial success with their prior
ventures. The inspiration behind launching NEWZ stems from a commitment to empower investors in navigating the
overwhelming surge of information (News Media) via the use of AI. Understanding the challenges investors face in
navigating the relentless flow of information, the firm utilizes AI technology to transform the way investors stay
updated and make informed decisions.Innovative Investment StrategyThe Fund is actively-managed and seeks
to achieve its investment objective by leveraging artificial intelligence ("AI") and natural language processing to
derive a proprietary News Media Sentiment Signal. Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of
its net assets (plus the amounts of any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of U.S.-listed large, mid
and small capitalization companies and American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"). StockSnips gathers news
information using news articles, blogs and other textual information on a daily basis and evaluates such information
along with a proprietary historical sentiment dataset covering approximately 5,000 US equities. The algorithms rank
the securities in the investment universe based on the amount of positive news available about a company and its
sentiment momentum. The top 30 to 50 stocks are included in the Fund and are equal weighted. The Sub-Adviser
expects that under normal market conditions, up to 95% of the portfolio assets will be invested in the securities
recommended by the algorithms.Why buy NEWZ?Captures News Media Sentiment, a proxy for Investor
Sentiment: A proven lead indicator to price movement left out of most portfolios.Diversified US Equity Holdings:
Seeking uncorrelated returns.Systematic Rebalancing: Using AI to seek dynamic & unemotional adaptation to
changing market conditions.A Milestone for StockSnips "This launch marks a pivotal moment in our journey at
StockSnips," said Ravi Koka, CEO and Founder. "With NEWZ, we are not just offering an investment product; we
are inviting investors to experience the future of finance, and we envision the future of investing to be increasingly
characterized by systematically managed portfolios, ones that harness unique data sets and state-of-the-art
technologies such as AI and Machine Learning. This approach holds the promise to deliver remarkable value to
investors, akin to the revolution brought about by passive indexed funds over the past two decades."About
