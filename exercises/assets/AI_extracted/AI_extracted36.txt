The following information was released by the California Hospital Association (CHA):

Heading into the second half of 2024, there are several exciting educational opportunities from CHA that you and
your teams depending on their area of responsibility and interest would benefit from attending.

Disaster Planning On Sept. 10 and Sept. 11, CHA will host its annual disaster planning conference in Pasadena.
This year's agenda highlights health care case studies from various disasters, including lessons learned on
vulnerability assessments and business continuity planning from those who have lived through the worst of it all.
Breakout sessions enable attendees to drill down on specific topics, such as cybersecurity, after-action reporting,
surge planning, and more.

Volunteers On Sept. 16 and Sept. 17, the California Hospital Volunteer Leadership Conference, in its 61st year, will
be held in San Diego. With so many hospitals relying on volunteers for ancillary services, patient support, and more,
gatherings like these are key to reinvigorate volunteer programs and learn from peers about strategies to retain and
recruit the next generation of these essential members of hospital teams.

Quality and Safety On Oct. 20 and Oct. 21, the Hospital Quality Institute's annual conference in Lake Tahoe will
focus on how new technology is driving change in the patient safety movement. Artificial intelligence (AI) could
help health care workers diagnose conditions earlier, bridge language barriers, revolutionize telehealth and
discharge experiences, and more. It also raises equity and ethics questions. Keynote speakers include Gurpreet
Dhaliwal, MD, UCSF clinician/national expert on AI in health care; Diana Nyad, international long-distance
swimming champion/hall of famer; and Stephen Shedletzky, Author of Speak-Up Culture: When Leaders Truly
Listen, People Step Up.

Behavioral Health On Dec. 4 and Dec. 5, CHA's annual behavioral health care symposium will be held in Long
Beach with significant attention on behavioral health care and California's youth population. The agenda is still
being developed, but registration is open now.

Along with the amazing content being offered at each of these opportunities, there is really no way to quantify the
value of being among peers and having the chance to share, learn, and laugh with each other. Hope we will see
many of you soon.
