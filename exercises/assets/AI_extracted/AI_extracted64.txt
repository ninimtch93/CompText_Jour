PR NewswirePITTSBURGH, May 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Expedient, a leading provider of cloud infrastructure and
managed services, has unveiled its latest innovation: the Secure AI Gateway. This corporate-ready offering is
designed to simplify access and maximize the value of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for enterprises and
organizations of all sizes.

 "The productivity boost that AI delivers is undeniable and increasingly well documented. But as more and more
users embrace it in their everyday work, the risk of leaking sensitive or confidential information goes up
exponentially, which represents a material risk for an organization,"says Bryan Smith, CEO at Expedient. "Secure
AI Gateway gives organizations a foundation for using AI in a safe, transparent, and scalable way." According to a
451 Research's recent Voice of the Enterprise: AI & Machine Learning, Infrastructure study1, security is the top
concern of organizations when considering their AI/ML implementation. Additionally, the report revealed widespread
concerns about reliability and ease of use.Expedient's newSecure AI Gatewayaddresses these concerns head-on.
To prevent the sharing of proprietary data externally, the gateway can be configured to block the release of
sensitive data or personally identifiable information to public AI models. Users securely access approved AI models
through single-sign-on (SSO) authentication connected to an organization's user directory, allowing administrators
to monitor usage. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides organizations with the ability to control what data
and AI models users have access to based on their role, and integrated observability tools deliver a comprehensive
view of usage and identify security vulnerabilities.Expedient's Secure AI Gateway supports multiple AI models
simultaneously and delivers out-of-the-box access to leading models like OpenAI's GPT-4, Meta's LLAMA,
Anthropic's Claude, Mistral's Mixtral, and Cohere's Command, along with others.With a full suite of text and image-
focused AI models available, users benefit from a single interface that they can access multiple AI resources. In
addition to chat, custom applications can be built on top of the gateway, leveraging its API access, to meet the
specific needs of the business."Secure AI Gateway is our first offering in the AI CTRL family that sets the
foundation for providing secure access to AI tools so that organizations are comfortable empowering their
employees to unlock the benefits of AI. We have more to come throughout 2024," Smith said. The rest of the suite
will confront the hurdles companies face in adopting AI including connecting multiple data sources, improving model
performance and accuracy, and hosting private AI models for when clients want to keep 100 percent of their data
inside their environment. This suite starts with security and employee empowerment to eliminate "shadow AI" but
also demystifies the process of integrating AI, providing clear guidance on where to begin and which technologies
to utilize. "This offering assists our clients in making their first move toward responsible AI adoption,"saysBradley
Reynolds, SVP for artificial intelligence at Expedient. "Our objective is to simplify AI adoption and enable clients
to create applications that address their business issues with minimal coding. We envision a future that seamlessly

integrates AI models and corporate data amassed over decades, helping organizations securely leverage and
manage this emerging technology for maximum impact."Other AI CTRL offerings will deliver seamless connectivity
to hundreds of data sources, sophisticated AI-ready storage for improved accuracy and performance, along with
options for secure private model hosting for data that you never want to leave your infrastructure. AI CTRL will
streamline data access, bolster semantic search and retrieval capabilities, and ensure robust security for sensitive
data. Key features include real-time data access from sources like databases, SaaS platforms, and spreadsheets,
and the use of vector databases to enhance the efficiency of AI models. The incorporation of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) will significantly improve response accuracy and relevance while dramatically reducing
hallucinations. To find out more about Expedient AI CTRLclick here.About ExpedientExpedient is a full stack
