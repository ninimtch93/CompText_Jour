 Bayanat AI (ADX:BAYANAT) and Al Yah Satellite Communications (ADX:YAHSAT) placed the United Arab
Emirate's first synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, satellite into orbit, marking an inaugural step in their earth
observation space program, according to an Aug. 17 announcement.

Under the in-country space program created in 2023, the duo aims to build a constellation of at least five SAR Low
Earth orbit, or LEO, satellites, which provide high-resolution geospatial images promptly for applications in disaster
management, maritime surveillance and smart mobility. The insights can be provided day and night, regardless of
weather conditions or solar illumination.

Finnish satellite imaging company ICEYE, which operates the world's largest constellation of SAR satellites,
manufactured and launched the debutant satellite for Bayanat and Al Yah on Aug. 16 from the Vandenberg Space
Force Base in California, US. Bayanat, a geospatial artificial intelligence company, owns the satellite conducting
early routine operations after establishing communication.

Bayanat and the UAE's flagship satellite telecommunication company Al Yah are advancing the UAE's space sector
ahead of the completion of their planned merger to become an artificial intelligence-powered space technology
major in the Middle East and North Africa region. Subject to obtaining regulatory and other relevant approvals, the
merger is expected to close in the second half of 2024.

"The successful launch of our SAR satellite is a testament to the synergies between Bayanat and Yahsat as we
press ahead with the anticipated merger to form Space42. The SAR satellite constellation to be launched over the
next 3 years will enable us to expand as a multi-orbit satellite operator, encompassing Geostationary Orbit and Low
Earth Orbit satellites while also developing satellite manufacturing capabilities in the UAE," said Al Yah Satellite
Chief Executive Officer Ali Al Hashemi.
