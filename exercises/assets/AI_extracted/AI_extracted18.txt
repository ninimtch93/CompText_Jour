Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, issued the following news release:

Today, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee passed four bills on a bipartisan basis to advance
research and technology development, ensuring that the United States remains a global leader in artificial
intelligence, energy, and natural disaster resilience:

H.R. 9671(link is external), the Department of Energy (DOE) Artificial Intelligence Act, provides updated guidance
for DOE's activities in developing advanced artificial intelligence systems to carry out its national security, energy,
and scientific discovery missions. H.R. 9710(link is external), the Small Modular Reactor Demonstration Act, gives
direction and guidance to DOE to create demonstration projects and empower research on small modular reactors
and micro-reactors. H.R. 9720(link is external), the AI Incident Reporting and Security Enhancement Act, directs
National Institute Standards and Technologies (NIST) to use existing vulnerability management processes to
account for AI vulnerabilities. H.R. 9723(link is external), the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program
Reauthorization Act, reauthorizes and revamps NIST's program to improve collaboration and research on the
effects of climate change on windstorm behavior.

Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04), a member of the House Science Committee, successfully offered an
amendment to H.R. 9723 based on her recently introduced H.R. 9771(link is external), the Building and Upgrading
Infrastructure for the Long Term (BUILT) Act. McClellan's amendment will support interdisciplinary coordination to
address the risks to infrastructure integrity resulting from changing climate and environmental conditions. Watch her
testimony in committee here(link is external).

"As the climate crisis continues to worsen, we must take immediate action to mitigate the most devastating impacts
and protect our communities and critical infrastructure systems from harm," said Congresswoman McClellan.
"Devastating extreme weather events remind us of the urgency of the moment and the need to continue improving
our resiliency efforts. I offered provisions from my BUILT Act as an amendment to the National Windstorm Impact
Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2024 to invest in our future by promoting forward-looking research into
climate resiliency."

                                                                                              Page 2 of 3

                                         Energy, and Natural Disasters

The BUILT Act directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to facilitate research on how
climate conditions can affect subsurface properties and how technology can be used to assess infrastructure
integrity risks, as well as to convene a workshop of representatives across the public and private sector.

The BUILT Act is endorsed by the American Geophysical Union and the National Institute of Building Sciences.
Both are concerned with the advancement of solutions to solve local and community-based problems with the built
environment.

"The nation's deficient infrastructure must be improved to protect American lives," said Dr. George Guszcza,
President and CEO of the National Institute of Building Sciences. "NIST recognizes the role lifeline infrastructure
plays to support community resilience and recovery after disasters. Together, we can build a framework to design
resilient buildings and infrastructure."
