LOS ANGELES, July 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the start of the 2024 Fire Season, AX’s FireScout AI
SaaS technology emerges as a leading technology on a global basis, in combating these devastating events. The
fire season has barely begun, yet communities around the globe are already experiencing unprecedented
challenges. Early reports indicate a severe season ahead, with increasing numbers of wildfires and acres burned.

AX is a global leader in advanced technology solutions, with a presence spanning the United States, Korea,
Australia, and Europe. “Our mission is to provide cutting-edge, AI-driven solutions to address some of the world’s
most pressing issues, including wildfire management,” said Michael Plaksin, the President and CEO of AX. He
adds, “FireScout, our state-of-the-art AI SaaS technology, has already demonstrated significant success in early
detection and rapid response to wildfires, helping to save lives, property, and natural resources.”

FireScout’s innovative approach utilizes advanced algorithms and real-time data to identify fire threats faster and
more accurately than traditional methods. This proactive system enables firefighting teams to respond swiftly,
minimizing the impact of wildfires. Our technology has been implemented across various regions, yielding
remarkable results in reducing the devastation caused by these natural disasters.

Despite our global successes, the situation in California highlights the urgent need for enhanced fire management
solutions.

The latest statistics from California are alarming:
    •     Over 312,403 total emergency responses have been recorded year-to-date.
    •     More than 3,499 wildfires have occurred, almost double the five-year average.
    •     Over 197,288 acres have burned, nearly 12x the five-year average.
    •     128 structures have been damaged or destroyed.
    •     Average Impact of Wildfires in California: $5B per year, and growing.

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 3

                                                    the Crisis

These numbers do not even account for the upcoming peak months of July through September, indicating a
worsening trend that requires immediate action.

FireScout is not presently being utilized on as many of California cameras, leaving the state without the
internationally proven benefits and accuracy of AX’s advanced AI technology, being able to detect fires in less than
1 minute, and providing notifications to first responders anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours prior to a 911 call. It
appears, the present alternatives have proven to be insufficient in addressing the scale and intensity of the current
and growing fire threats.

The State of California urgently needs a more advanced artificial intelligence fire detection software program to
support and combat the escalating wildfire crisis. FireScout’s proven effectiveness in early detection and rapid
response would be a game-changer for California, as it already has in the recent past, providing the much-needed
edge to protect lives, properties, and the environment.
