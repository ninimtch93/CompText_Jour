PR NewswireMOBILE, Ala., Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nfina announces the release of the4508T-AI
Workstation. Powered by NVIDIA® GPUs, this eight-bay workstation offers software developers, data scientists,
and academia a high-performance, cost-effective platform to develop cutting-edge AI models and run AI-based
applications.Putting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to work at scale requires preprocessing, training, and deployment.
There are different development toolchains, frameworks, and workloads, all of which create unique obstacles and
require a different amount of computing power.

That's where Nfina's 4508T-AI Workstation comes in.Powered by 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable
Processors, 5600MT/s speed memory, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPUs, the 4508T-AI Workstation excels at
dynamic calculations and high-precision computing workflows.The 5th Gen Intel Xeon processors, equipped with AI
acceleration in every core, speed up training and deep-learning inference to handle demanding AI workloads and
eliminate the need for additional discrete accelerators. According to Intel, these processors offer 42% faster
inference performance and less than 100 millisecond latency on large language models (LLMs) with under 20 billion
parameters compared to the previous generation.The NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU with 48GB/s memory boasts 2x
the speed, throughput, and AI performance of previous generations. RTX 6000 provides next-generation rendering,
AI graphics, and petaflop inferencing performance by combining 142 RT Cores, 668 Tensor Cores, and 18,176
CUDA cores. The RTX 6000 supports CUDA™ API and NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation Software™.To effectively
manage the extensive requirements of AI, the 4508T-AI Workstation supports up to 144TB of onboard storage,
geo-redundant cloud storage, and Nfina JBOD expansion devices.For a powerful end-to-end AI solution, Nfina
recommends NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription and OS support. NVIDIA AI Enterprise not only includes an
extensive library of NVIDIA frameworks and pre-trained models but alleviates the challenges of AI workloads by
integrating different open-source data analytics, modeling, deep-learning frameworks, and deployment tools such
as PyTorch™, TensorFlow™, scikit-learn™, and XGBoost™.President and CEO of Nfina, Warren Nicholson, states
"Nfina recognizes the importance of reliability in demanding applications like AI, which is why our deep learning
workstations undergo rigorous testing to ensure they can handle continuous heavy workloads without compromising
stability or data integrity. With these state-of-the-art workstations at your disposal, artificial intelligence has never
been easier or more accessible."The new Nfina system is available now throughNfina's partner network.All Nfina
systems can be purchased outright or bundled with Nfina's managed services to fit business application needs and
monthly budgets.About Nfina Technologies:Nfina is an IT infrastructure manufacturer and solutions provider
supplying cyber resilience for business continuity. Our IT solutions and services includeHybrid
Cloud,Hyperconverged,Storage,Servers,AI Workstations,Backup and Disaster Recovery, andCloud Hosting. IT
departments have trusted Nfina Technologies to protect their computing and storage equipment from vulnerabilities
