WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued the following speech text:

Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief
Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) Eric Hysen announced the Department's first-ever hiring sprint to recruit 50
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology experts in 2024. The new DHS "AI Corps" is modeled after the U.S. Digital
Service, building teams that will help better leverage this new technology responsibly across strategic areas of the
homeland security enterprise including efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and abuse,
deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity.

The AI Corps will bolster the DHS workforce with experts in AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, models,
and applications who will support policy initiatives to ensure the safe and secure use of AI, while protecting privacy
and civil rights and civil liberties.

Using the Office of Personnel Management's new flexible hiring authorities for AI-related jobs, DHS has worked to
streamline and expedite the federal hiring process to ensure qualified candidates receive offers as quickly as
possible.

"As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful and more accessible than ever before, government needs the
support and expertise of our country's foremost AI experts to help ensure our continued ability to harness this
technology responsibly, safeguard against its malicious use, and advance our critical homeland security mission,"
said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. "Our new AI Corps initiative will make it easier to
bring these talented, experienced, creative men and women into public service quickly. The DHS AI Corps will
enable the Department of Homeland Security to keep up with the pace of innovation as we enhance our work
combating fentanyl traffickers, rescuing victims of child sexual exploitation, countering cyberattacks, assessing
disaster damage, and much more."
