The National Environmental Health Association issued the following news release on May 24, 2024:

Our leadership and staff provided thought leadership and represented the workforce and association at the 17th
IFEH World Congress on Environmental Health in Perth, Australia, on May 20-24, 2024. The congress provides a
platform for environmental health practitioners and industries to share knowledge on emerging techniques,
developments, and innovations in the field.

Aligned with the conference theme, Environmental Health In The New Era, we shared insight on risk
communication, emergency readiness, artificial intelligence (AI), and environmental health policy.

NEHA President-Elect CDR Anna Khan conducted a 2-day, sold-out preconference workshop on risk
communication while Dr. Jesse Bliss, our director of Program and Partnership Development, delivered a standing-
room-only session on emergency readiness and AI. Our Executive Director Dr. David Dyjack led a discussion on
the future of the profession. Further, Dour Farquhar, our director of Government Affairs, presented virtually on
environmental health policy and international uniformity. Nearly 700 professionals from 27 countries participated in
the event.

"While cultures and monetary currencies vary by country, the challenges the profession encounters worldwide are
remarkably similar. Speakers unpacked issues related to academic enrollments, local politics, and the dynamic
conditions associated with climate change," said Dr. Dyjack. "Implications and solutions related to retail food safety,
disaster readiness, wildfires, and healthy homes dominated the agenda."

In total, we led two full-day preconference workshops, delivered two plenary presentations, and were central to two
plenary panel discussions. We were also delighted to learn that several local South Pacific environmental health
practitioners and academics plan to attend and speak at our upcoming 204 Annual Educational Conference (AEC)
& Exhibition in Pittsburgh.

The World Congress was made possible by the efforts of the International Federation of Environmental Health
(IFEH) and Environmental Health Australia.
